INNOVA - DATA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IDEATION

Members of the Global Partnership on Sustainable Development Data/ the Kenyan GVT – The National
Partnership on Sustainable Development Data and the broader public will host a “data hackathon” in early
December bringing together policy makers, data scientists, and web developers. Our aim will be to kickstart
new ways to source, analyze, and share data for sustainable development. This event will be a pilot, which if
a success will provide the basis for replicable events an on ongoing basis during the 15 year lifespan of the
goals.

The event will be hosted in Kenya School of Government and the Laico Regency where directors of listed
departments of GVT agencies and organizations working in the theme areas will share their status
documents. This will also enable the results of the INNOVA to be shared publicly at a time when the world’s
attention will be focused on these new goals. Advocacy and media groups are planning a campaign to reach
2 million people.

During the INNOVA, leaders from the government, the World Bank and non-governmental organizations will
present specific data challenges they face in terms of measuring and achieving the SDG targets as related to
the mission of their program or organization. Participants will be invited to propose and prototype novel,
experimental approaches to address such gaps.

For instance, they may attack issues in:
Analysis: Identify new correlations or patterns by matching previously separate datasets
Sourcing: Identify novel ways to apply data from publically available sources such as satellite
imagery or cell phone databases to answer previously-unknowable questions
Presentation: Find ways to make new and existing datasets more accessible and usable to the
public, such as via web dashboards or maps

This INNOVA will focus on a subset of the 17 goals based on the specific challenges policy leaders identify.
The preliminary goals the hackathon will focus on are:
WOMEN & GIRLS;
TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE
HEALTH
FOOD SECURITY (AGRICULTURE);
CLIMATE CHANGE/DISASTER MANAGEMENT

More broadly, the hackathon will have two overarching goals:
At tactical, short-term level, identify and explore innovative ways of communicating,
sharing, and (potentially) sourcing data relevant to specific SDG’s (e.g., gender, poverty,
climate, ag)
At a strategic, long-term level, promote better relationships between the international
policy and data communities. This hackathon would be seen as a pilot, the first of
ongoing hackathons in support of the Global Partnership for Sustainable
Development Data, providing a the foundation for longer term collaborations. (After
all, we do not expect to solve all the problems of the world in one hacking session!)
